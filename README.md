# Homelab-Documentation-Generator
I need a system that automatically scans my entire self-hosted infrastructure and generates comprehensive, always-up-to-date documentation that would allow someone (like my wife if something happened to me) to understand, maintain, and recover my homelab. This should be the "I got hit by a bus" documentation.
